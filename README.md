> ðŸŒ² Load [pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) logs into CouchDB (or Cloudant, for that matter)

Actually it will convert any data from `stdin` (not just `pino` logs) and if it can parse it  
as `JSON` then it will insert that into `couch` otherwise it will insert that as it is, but with `msg` field and a timestamp.

Based upon [pino-mongodb](https://github.com/Kuroljov/pino-mongodb)

## Install

```
npm i -g pino-couch
```

## Usage

Write logs into CouchDB

```
node my-app.js | pino-couch [options]
```

Write logs into CouchDB, and still format them nicely to the console:

```
npm i -g pino
node my-app.js | pino-couch [options] | pino
```
